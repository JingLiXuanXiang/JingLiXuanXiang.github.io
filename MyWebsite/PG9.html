		<h1>You Have Entered deeper into Forest2</h1>
		<p> You walked for a very long time, no matter which way you walk, you walk to the same palce, your head started to feel dizzy, you heard howling sound getting closer to you. All of a sudden you feel a weight on your eyelid.</p>

		<p>When you open your eye you were in the hospital with Abby sitting on your bed.</p>
